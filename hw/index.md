# Assignments for COMP492

## Overview of the senior seminar project

The most significant component of COMP492 is the continuation of the
senior seminar project started in COMP491. As is usual for
COMP491/492, some students work in teams on contributions to a
large-scale pre-existing open-source project; others work individually
on a research project.

The goals for the project are the same as for COMP491:
* For open-source projects, the goal is to make meaningful
  contributions to the upstream project, which can include:
  documentation improvements, bug gardening, bug fixes, commenting on
  issues, resolutions of issues, and any other contributions. It is
  highly desirable to have contributions accepted by the upstream
  project maintainers, but it is also possible for a senior seminar
  project to succeed in many other ways.
* For research projects, the goal is to produce empirical and/or
  theoretical results that address the research question.

In all cases, grading of assignments related to the senior seminar
project will take into account demonstrated effort as well as concrete
achievements. This principle applies to 5-15 reports, the checkpoint
presentation, the poster presentation and the final presentation. The
best way to demonstrate effort is to maintain a detailed and regular
Slack live-log, as described next.

## Slack live-logs

A Slack live-log is a Slack channel that will be used to assess effort
invested in the senior seminar project. You may also use the same
channel for communication among your team members, but its primary
purpose is as a detailed diary to show the instructor when you have
been working on which tasks. It is recommended that you log some kind
of message every 30 minutes while working. Typically, you would
describe in 1-2 sentences what you achieved in the last 30 minutes and
what you are planning to do in the next 30 minutes.
