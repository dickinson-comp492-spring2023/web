# Research paper assignments (RP1 and RP2)

## Overview

For RP1, you will choose a research paper published at a recent top-tier
database research conference known as VLDB (International Conference
on Very Large Databases). For RP2, you will give a presentation on the content
of your chosen paper.

You can complete these two assignments individually or in a team of
two. Note, however, that you cannot work with the same partner on this
assignment and on the final project (FP1-FP4). If you would like the
instructor to find a partner for you, please just ask.

## RP1 (120 points)

RP1 consists of two main steps. First, you must choose your
paper. Then, submit a document answering a few questions about the
paper. These two steps are outlined below.

### Step 1 of RP1: choose your paper

VLDB, officially known as the International Conference on Very Large
Databases, is a prestigious annual conference presenting original
research about databases. Only about 20% of papers submitted to the
conference are accepted for presentation and publication. Therefore,
papers published in the proceedings of the conference are likely to be
of high quality. The title of the conference reflects its focus at the
time when it was founded in the 1970s, but these days the conference
is about all types of database research, not just "very large"
databases.

You must choose a paper that was published in one of the two most
recent VLDB conferences: [VLDB 2021](http://vldb.org/2021/) or [VLDB
2020](https://vldb2020.org/). As each conference accepts hundreds of
papers, this may be rather overwhelming. To help narrow your choice,
you can choose to focus on just the papers that were awarded
prizes. The prize-winning papers are listed at the following links:

* [VLDB 2021 award papers](https://vldb.org/2021/?conference-awards):
  Any of the first four award-winning papers can be chosen. The "Best
  Demonstration Award" paper is not eligible.
* [VLDB 2020 award
  papers](https://vldb2020.org/vldb-2020-awards.html): The "Best
  Demonstration" and "Best Demonstration Runner-up" papers are not
  eligible. Any of the others, including runner-up or honorable
  mention, may be chosen.

You are also free to choose any other paper published in one of the
main research tracks at these two conferences. PDF versions of these
papers are available at the following links:

* [VLDB 2021 all papers](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14-volume-info/):
  Click on paper title to download PDF.
* [VLDB 2020 all papers](https://vldb2020.org/program_flat.html):
  Click on "download PDF" to view a paper. A free registration is
  required.
  
Each individual and/or team must choose a different paper. Papers will
be assigned on a first-come first-served basis. You can see a list of
papers that have already been chosen at the following link:

Here is a list of papers already chosen (which may be out of date but
the instructor will try to add information whenever possible):

### Step 2 of RP1: submit paper description

For this part of the assignment, you must submit to Moodle a document
answering the following questions. The submission is due at the start
of class on the due date listed on the class schedule.

In answering the following questions, you are not required to do
extensive reading or research. It should be possible to answer the
questions based only on reading the abstract, introduction, and
conclusion of your chosen paper. You may also find it useful to
examine the figures and captions in the main body of the paper,
without trying to understand all details.

Below are the questions to be answered in your submission. In each
case, one sentence should be sufficient to answer the question.

1. Give the full citation of your chosen paper in APA
   format. Example: 
   * Kandula, S., Orr, L., & Chaudhuri, S. (2019). Pushing
     data-induced predicates through joins in big-data
     clusters. _Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment_, 13(3), 252-265.

1. What is the main problem the authors are trying to solve? In other
   words, what is the main research question of the paper?
   
1. What is the main idea that the authors use to solve the problem you
   identified in the previous question? Note that you are not required
   to understand any technical details at this stage. You can re-state
   the authors' claims without necessarily understanding them.
   
1. What kind of experiments did the authors run to demonstrate that
   their solution to the research problem is a good one?
   
1. Based on the citations given in the introduction of the paper (or
   possibly elsewhere), guess which previously-published paper is the
   most closely related to this one. Give a citation of that paper in
   APA format as your answer to this question.
   
1. Obtain a PDF version of the closely-related paper you identified in
   the previous question. Most likely it will be freely available. If
   not, you will need to submit an inter-library loan request to the
   Dickinson library. As your answer to this question, state whether
   you have already obtained the PDF or, alternatively, describe how
   you submitted your request for it.


## RP2 (300 points)

The final objective of RP2 is to give a presentation explaining the
content of your chosen paper to our class. To achieve this, you will

* read your chosen paper carefully
* read one other background paper lightly (most likely, the paper you
  identified at the end of RP1)
* do a small amount of additional background research if necessary
* create your presentation
* deliver your presentation in class

The amount of time required to achieve all of the above will vary
according to many factors such as the nature of the paper that you
chose, but a reasonable target would be at least five hours of
preparation.

Your presentation should be about 10 minutes in length, and there will
be about five minutes of questions from the audience afterwards.

You must submit your slides, in any reasonable format, to Moodle
before the start of the class in which you are delivering your
presentation.

To achieve an excellent grade, your presentation should excel on the
following aspects. It should:

* meet the target length of ten minutes, plus or minus two minutes;
* clearly explain the problem that the paper is trying to solve, or
  the research problem being addressed;
* clearly explain the method used to solve the problem and/or address
  the research question;
* clearly explain any experiments demonstrating the success of the
  main idea;
* use clear and engaging visual materials (slides and/or whiteboard);
* employ large fonts that are very easy for the audience to read and
  use only a small number of words on every slide so that every word
  can be read by the audience;
* be delivered in a clear, engaging, and fluent voice;
* be delivered without reading verbatim from notes or slides (it is a
  good idea to use notes&mdash;just don't read from them word for
  word);
* demonstrate a level of understanding of the technical material that
  is achievable by an undergraduate student (you are not expected to
  master all technical details);
* demonstrate some understanding of at least one additional background
  source;
* include a list of sources in APA format, including the chosen paper
  and at least one additional background paper.

Note that it will not be possible to explain everything about the
paper within the 10-minute time limit. Part of the challenge of this
assignment is to judiciously choose which material to explain and
which to leave out.
