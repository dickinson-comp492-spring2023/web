# Classic paper assignments

The two classic paper assignments (CP1 and CP2) each have the same structure, described in the following sequence of steps.

1. Carefully read the assigned readings. Make notes (preferably
   handwritten on paper) that you can bring with you to the discussion
   session.

1. Before 8 AM on the day of the discussion session, post at least one
   question to the Moodle forum for the discussion.
   * At least one of your posted questions should demonstrate that you
     have thought about the assigned reading and gained insight into
     it.
   * If there are aspects of the reading you do not understand, you
     are encouraged to post questions asking for information or
     explanations. But this probably does not count as your question
     that demonstrates insight.
   
1. Optionally, respond to one or more of the questions posted by other
   class members.
   
1. Attend the discussion session and participate actively.
   
1. _[This applies only if you are unable to attend the discussion.]_
   If you are absent from the discussion session (regardless of
   whether your absence is excused in advance or not), you must still
   post discussion questions as described above, **and** you must
   write a blog post about the reading. In your blog post, discuss and
   respond to one or more of the questions posted by other
   students. Your post should be made publicly available online
   somewhere (e.g. tumblr.com). The post must be at least 800 words in
   length. Submit a link to your blog post to the Moodle forum. The
   link must be submitted within three days of our discussion session.

To obtain an excellent grade on these assignments, you must excel on
the following aspects.

* At least one of your posted questions demonstrates insight into the
  assigned reading.
* Your participation in the classroom discussion demonstrates insight
  into and curiosity about the reading.
  

## CP1 (100 points)

There are two assigned readings for this session, both available on
Moodle:
* "Needles in the World's Biggest Haystack: The algorithm that ranked
  the internet": This is definitely not a classic paper. It is a
  short, light overview of the significance of Google's PageRank
  algorithm. This reading will help provide perspective and background
  for the classic paper described next.
* "The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine." This
  paper was written by the two co-founders of Google, Sergey Brin and
  Larry Page. It describes Google's famous PageRank algorithm and was
  originally published in the proceedings of the 1998 International
  Conference on the World Wide Web.
  
## CP2 (100 points)

There is one assigned reading for this session, available on Moodle:

* Sweeney, L. (1997). Weaving technology and policy together to
  maintain confidentiality. _The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics_,
  25(2-3), 98-110.
  - The author of this paper is [Latanya
    Sweeney](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/latanya-sweeney), who
    is the Daniel Paul Professor of the Practice of Government and
    Technology at Harvard.
